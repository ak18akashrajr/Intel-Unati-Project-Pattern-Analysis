# Intel Unati Project Pattern Analysis

## Overview

The Intel Unati Project Pattern Analysis is a research initiative aimed at developing advanced analytics and pattern recognition techniques for analyzing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) collision warnings. The primary objective of this project is to uncover road-type accident patterns by scrutinizing the data generated from ADAS collision warnings.

## Problem Statement

### Analyzing ADAS Collision Warnings

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have become integral components in modern vehicles, providing drivers with collision warnings to enhance road safety. However, the wealth of data generated by these systems presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into road-type accident patterns. The Unati Project focuses on the following aspects:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather and curate a diverse dataset of ADAS collision warnings, capturing various road conditions, weather scenarios, and driver behaviors.

2. **Pattern Recognition:** Develop advanced analytics and machine learning models to analyze the collected data and identify patterns in collision warnings.

3. **Road-Type Accident Patterns:** Specifically, the project aims to categorize and analyze collision warnings based on road types (e.g., highways, urban roads, rural roads) to uncover distinct patterns associated with each type.

4. **Insights for Road Safety:** The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights to enhance road safety measures, guide infrastructure improvements, and contribute to the development of more effective ADAS systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks (for data exploration and analysis)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning model development)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/ak18akashrajr/Intel-Unati-Project-Pattern-Analysis.git]
   cd unati-project-pattern-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. Please contact the project administrators to obtain access to the dataset.

## Usage

1. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration and analysis.

2. Run the machine learning model scripts in the `models` directory to train and evaluate models.

3. Refer to the project documentation for detailed information on the analysis techniques and methodologies.

## Results

After thorough analysis, the team identified that a significant number of accidents occur at Royapuram (Chennai Port Entrance Road) with the coordinates (13°5'60"N, 80°17'59.99"E). This insight is crucial for implementing targeted safety measures in this specific location.
